## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: Angular 20+ with standalone components architecture
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4.1.11 with custom component classes using @apply
- **TypeScript**: Strict configuration with ES2022 target
- **Build System**: Angular CLI with production optimizations

### Component Structure
- Standalone component architecture (no NgModules)
- Interface-driven development with strict typing
- Change detection optimization using OnPush strategy
- Semantic HTML with accessibility attributes

## Key Components

### Core Components
1. **AppComponent**: Main application shell with sample data and dark mode toggle
2. **WorklogSummaryCardComponent**: Reusable card component with role-based styling
3. **WorkLogSummary Interface**: Type definition for worklog data structure

### Styling Architecture
- **Custom CSS Layer**: Component-specific styles using Tailwind's @apply directive
- **Role-based Classes**: Dynamic styling based on user roles (admin, manager, employee)
